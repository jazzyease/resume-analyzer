Engineered a robust NLP pipeline processing 10,000+ resumes, implementing advanced text extraction from PDF/DOCX formats,\nsemantic analysis for skill identification, and domain-specific matching algorithms that consider experience levels, education, and\nprofessional domains. Matches resumes with job descriptions with high accuracy and determined if candidates are fit for a job or in what areas are they lacking.",

Preprocessed and engineered features from 10,730 sensor measurements across multiple train subsystems, including traction, braking,\nand door mechanisms, implementing effective data normalization and temporal sliding window techniques. Validated the model's performance on historical failure cases from the Metro PD dataset, achieving an early warning time of 5-7 days\nbefore actual component failures.",

Used KNN(K Nearest Neighbour) and CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) for making the machine learning model. Finally compared the accuracies achieved by each model in recognising the handwritten text. Lovley Professional University Jalandhar, Punjab\nExploratory Data Analysis on Zomato Bangalore data Nov 2022 - Dec 2022\nPerformed exploratory data analysis using Python on the restaurants in Bangalore dataset by Zomato. Found out what locations, cuisines, services should a budding restaurant offer to maximise its profits. Used pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn libraries to clean, visualise and represent the data respectively.
