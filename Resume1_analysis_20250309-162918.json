Preprocessed and engineered features from 10,730 sensor measurements across multiple train subsystems, including traction, braking,\nand door mechanisms, implementing effective data normalization and temporal sliding window techniques. Validated the model's performance on historical failure cases from the Metro PD dataset, achieving an early warning time of 5-7 days\nbefore actual component failures.",
